Dataset Description — Indian Bollywood Music Genre Clips

The dataset consists of short audio clips (≈45 seconds each) belonging to five major Indian music genres. The objective of the dataset is to support music-genre classification and audio feature analysis for Bollywood and traditional Indian music.

The dataset is structured into genre-specific folders as shown below:

Bollywood Pop (bollypop)

Carnatic

Ghazal

Semi-classical

Sufi

Each folder contains labeled audio samples corresponding to its genre, enabling supervised learning tasks. All tracks are taken from popular and traditional Indian music sources, trimmed to uniform length (around 45 seconds), and organized for consistency in training and evaluation of machine learning models.

This dataset is particularly suitable for:

Genre classification

Music Information Retrieval (MIR)

Audio feature extraction (MFCC, Spectrogram, Chroma, etc.)
