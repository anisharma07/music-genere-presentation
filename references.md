Title: Does Genre Mean Anything: Classifying Music with Artificial Intelligence

https://www.wbu.edu/academics/schools/school-of-math-and-science/undergraduate-research/documents/Joffe%202023.pdf 

Context: A research project (Wayland Baptist University) investigating K-Means and Agglomerative clustering on the GTZAN dataset. It highlights the "low purity" issue where unsupervised clusters often fail to map 1:1 with human-defined genres.

Title: Mood Based Music Categorization System for Bollywood Music

Context: While often cited in 2023/2024 literature reviews (e.g., in surveys of Indian music classification), the foundational paper for this specific "Bollywood Mood Clustering" method was published earlier. This remains the primary reference for unsupervised mood clustering in Hindi music.

Title: Identification and Clustering of Unseen Ragas in Indian Art Music

Context: A very recent paper (arXiv preprint) dealing with the "Saraga" dataset. It proposes a novel class discovery method to cluster Indian classical music (Ragas) that the model has never seen before—highly relevant to your "discovery" objective.

Title: Enhanced Music Recommendation Systems: A Comparative Study of Content-Based Filtering and K-Means Clustering Approaches

Context: Published in the International Journal of Mathematical, Engineering and Management Sciences (or similar IIETA journal), this study explicitly uses Silhouette Scores to validate K-Means clustering on Spotify/GTZAN data.
